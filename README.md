# Godot-Remote-Transform-Debug-Project

This project is created to help debug RemoteTransforms in Godot.
To see the bug, open the project in the editor and run the main scene.
The blue item will rotate twice as fast as the green item, even though the remote transform should copy the green items global rotation to the blue item.
